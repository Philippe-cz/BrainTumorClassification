# BrainTumorClassification

This Jupyter Notebook contains an implementation of a deep learning model for brain tumor classification using MRI scans. 

**Model Architecture**
The deep learning model employed in this notebook utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract meaningful features from the MRI scans. It is trained on a set of labeled data. The model architecture includes multiple layers of convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.
**Training and Evaluation**
The notebook provides code for preprocessing the MRI scans and splitting the dataset into training, evaluation and testing sets. The model is trained on the training set, each epoch is evaluated on evaluation set. The testing set assess its classification performance. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics are used to measure the model's performance.
